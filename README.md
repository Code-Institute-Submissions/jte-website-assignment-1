The webpage focus on sharing information about JTE Recruit, services, when it was founded, people that are working in JTE and contact details.
Employer & employee can directly email or contact JTE Recruit from the webpage. (Mainly the webpage is for sharing JTE information)

Objective / Purpose

Used as a landing page to introduce my company to the public, as well as including a bit to jobseeker that are interested in joining JTE Recruit.


UX (Skeleton / Structure)
Strategy

1) The current aim of the webpage is to be able to provide a clean, vibrant and simple to read webpage to the public.
2) Current stage of the webpage is only for reading of information and some basic contact details.
3) Future planning for the webpage is to build the page into a job portal for jobseekers to apply, hence the webpage is in a more brighter color concept.

-When planning of project, i create the first thing for the user to be able to directly email us by clicking on the links whether you are a employer or jobseeker.
You may find the image in the folder "readMe Image" as reference for the follow 2 links.
-As the main purpose of the webpage is for Employer & Jobseeker, the page is directly target at these 2 group.
-You can see the flow of the webpage which is from About, Testimonial, Services, Join Us and contact.
Which a user can have a better understanding and better trust with JTE, with the pictures provided along the way and videos at join us. (Which currently can't be played due to huge files size)
-The color choice for the website is picked by a app "color picker" to have a better contrast and also with the brigher color to attract younger jobseeker user.
-Overall user experience is focusing on whether user is able to retrieve the information clearly and easily.


Features
1) When user came to the webpage, first thing they will be able to have access to email JTE base on their needs.
Whether they are Employeer seeking for recruitment services or Jobseeker looking for assistance in job findings.
2) At the about us section, the user will be able to have a clearer idea of the company history and also to build trust
as there are photos of the company staff which will providing certain assurance to the user when they are to send in their resume.
3) At the about us secton, user will be able to understand information such as number of staff, clients and applicants JTE

trust and chances of engaging JTE services.
5) For the services sections, which is more target for the Employer with clear information on what type of services are provided
and also when a user click it, it will show reasons why should Employer engage JTE. This will increase chances of business.

Testing

For the testing of the webpage, i have personally go through clicking and checking of the various links and screen sizing.
Additional i have engage 2 more friend of mine to go through the webpage, go the links are working fine only the bottom links at the contact us are not working as i did not add in the pages for it yet.

Other than the functionality of the webpage, i have gather feedback from 15 friends aging from 24 years to 35 years old on the layout and colors of the webpage.
They have read through all the information and instructions of how to send email, the feedback received are generally positive.

Also on the testing, i have used HTMLhint (https://htmlhint.io) and CSSLink (http://csslint.net) to test on the codes for my webpage to ensure no bug or errors.

Next i focus on the mobile visual a lot, hence you may try to play around with the screen size which i have try it on various size to ensure i make it responsive.
The main issue i face was the video section of Join us, even up to this stage i am not able to fix the alignment of the video to be in center when my screen size is in the tablet size.
For this case i have use margin to make it center.

The links at contact us are left deliberately not link to any page or parts of the webpage, as it is left for future upgrade.


Deployment

For deployment of the webpage i have been using Github.
Which i have commit on regularly basis to keep my code safe and up to date. Github assist and ensure my project able to run smoothly as if there are any major error or bugs i can upload from the last version.
