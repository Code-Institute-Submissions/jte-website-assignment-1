JTE Recruit Webpage

First assignment: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my company website to present to employers and jobseekers. 
The webpage is mainly used as landing page to introduce my company to the public, as well as including a bit to applicants that are interested in joining JTE Recruit.
